## Iteration 1 - 2025-01-25T13:35:00Z
Story: STORY-01 - Add get_form_state tool to return current form values
Status: COMPLETE

Changes made:
- supabase/functions/realtime-token/index.ts: Added get_form_state tool definition
- js/voice-commands.js: Added getFormState() method to RealtimeManager class

Learnings:
- Tool description is key - tells model WHEN to use the tool
- Including "ALWAYS call this first" in description guides model behavior

Verification:
- Edge function deployed successfully
- Endpoint returns token (tool is included in session config)

---

## Iteration 2 - 2025-01-25T13:40:00Z
Story: STORY-02 - Send initial form state to model on session connect
Status: COMPLETE

Changes made:
- js/voice-commands.js: Added sendInitialFormState() method
- Called automatically when data channel opens after WebRTC connection

Learnings:
- Sending form state as a "user" message with [SYSTEM CONTEXT] prefix gives model context
- Model will now know current values before user speaks

Verification:
- Code review confirms sendInitialFormState() is called in dataChannel.onopen

---

## Iteration 3 - 2025-01-25T13:45:00Z
Story: STORY-03 - Update system instructions to use form context
Status: COMPLETE

Changes made:
- supabase/functions/realtime-token/index.ts: Updated SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS
- Added "FORM STATE AWARENESS" section with clear instructions
- Updated examples to show partial requests (just change destination, keep rest)

Learnings:
- System instructions need explicit guidance about what NOT to ask
- Examples in system prompt help model understand expected behavior

Verification:
- Edge function deployed successfully
- Model should now use existing form values when user says "calculate costs"

## Summary
All 3 stories completed in 3 iterations.

Key changes:
1. get_form_state tool added - model can query current form values
2. Initial form state sent on connect - model has context before user speaks
3. System instructions updated - model instructed to use existing values

The voice assistant should now:
- Know what's currently in the form when the session starts
- Not ask for values that are already set
- Only ask for missing information
- Proceed with calculations using existing values
